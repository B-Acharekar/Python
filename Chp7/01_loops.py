# Loops help us repeat actions without writing the same code multiple times.

# Example without a loop
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)

# The same task using a 'for' loop
for i in range(1, 5):  # Loops through numbers 1 to 4
    print(i)

# Two main types of loops in Python:
# while loops
# for loops

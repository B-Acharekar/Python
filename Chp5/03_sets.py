# Set is a collection of non-repetitive elements.
# e = set()  # Use this to create an empty set
# Note: Avoid using s = {} as it creates an empty dictionary

set = {1, 5, 32, 5, 5}  # Duplicates will be automatically removed

print(set)

# PROPERTIES OF SETS:
# 1. Sets are unordered => The order of elements is not guaranteed.
# 2. Sets are unindexed => Elements cannot be accessed using an index.
# 3. Immutable elements => You cannot change individual items in a set.
# 4. No duplicates => Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values.

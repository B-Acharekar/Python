# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.
a = 1
b = 2
print( a + b)

# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
a = 34 
b = 5 
print("Remainder when a number is divided by b is :", a % b)

# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.
a = input("Enter the value of a: ")
print(type(a))

# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80
a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))
print("a is greater than b:", a > b) 

# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
a = int(input("Enter the value of a: "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b: "))

average = (a + b) / 2

print("Average of a and b is:", average)

#6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
d = int(input("Enter the number: "))
square = d**2
print("Square of the given number is:",d)
